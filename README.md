# java-chatroom
 A simple chatroom built on Java using embedded Jetty as its server (even uses Hadoop and Pig)

This project was entirely for learning purposes, with no real world use cases.

I just wanted to try hadoop/pig for the first time.

Hadoop version: 2.6.0

Pig version: 0.14.0

Please include the libraries accordingly.
